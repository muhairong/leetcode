# Description

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# Solution

- use a map store the char appears in the string
- if current char had already in the map, move the pointer to first duplicate element next position, store the longest length, and clear the map
```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int cnt = 0, longest = 0;
        map<char, int> p;
        while (r < s.size()) {
            if (p.empty() || p.count(s[r]) == 0) {
                p[s[r]] = r;
                cnt++;
                r++;
            }
            else {
                l = p[s[r]] + 1;
                r = l;
                longest = max(cnt, longest);
                p.clear();
                cnt = 0;
            }
        }
        return max(cnt, longest);
    }
};
```
