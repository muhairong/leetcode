# Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

# Solution

- if n > 0, and 1 get the last bit of n
- if it is 1, cnt += 1
- n >> 1

```
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (n) {
            if (n & 1)
                cnt++;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
