# Description

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

# Solution
- a function: isalnum
  - int isalnum ( int c ); Check if character is alphanumeric. Checks whether c is either a decimal digit or an uppercase or lowercase letter.
- note!! when check the character and change value of l and r, make sure that l < r
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        int l = 0, r = s.size()-1;
        while (l < r) {
            while (l < r && !isalnum(s[l]))
                l++;
            while (r > l && !isalnum(s[r]))
                r--;
            if (toupper(s[l]) != toupper(s[r]))
                return false;
            else {
                l++;
                r--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
