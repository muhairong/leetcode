# Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

# Solution

- Like 141, use two pointers, slow and fast. And if there is a cycle, they meet in a node.
- Assume head is A, the node they meet is C, the node where the cycle begins is B.
- slow: AB + BC
- fast: AB + BC + CB + BC
- slow * 2 = fast
- so, AB = CB
- move fast to head, and step is one. Fast and slow will meet at B.

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow, *fast;
        slow = fast = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (fast == slow) {
                fast = head;
                while (fast != slow) {
                    fast = fast->next;
                    slow = slow->next;
                }
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
```
