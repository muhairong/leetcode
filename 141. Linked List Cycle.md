# Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

# Solution
- Use two pointers, fast pointer moves two steps each time, and the slow one moves one step each time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, two pointers will meet sometime.
- Assume there is a cycle in the linked list. Fast pointer enters the cycle first, and then slow pointer enters. It just like the fast one is chasing the slow one. Because the difference between their steps is 1, fast one will meet the slow one finally

    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *fast, *slow;
        fast = slow = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (fast == slow)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
