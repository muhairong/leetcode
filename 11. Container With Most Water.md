# Description

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

# Solution

### method 1
- O(nÂ²)
- large set : Time Limit Exceeded
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int mw = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < height.size()-1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < height.size(); ++j) {
                int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
                int w = j - i;
                mw = max (mw, h*w);
            }
        }
        return mw;
    }
};
```

### method 2
- two pointers, l is at 0, r is at height.size()-1
- find smaller value between l and r, move it inside to find a bigger h
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int mw = 0;
        int l = 0, r = height.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int h = min(height[l], height[r]);
            mw = max(mw, h * (r - l));
            if (height[l] < height[r])
                l++;
            else
                r--;
        }
        return mw;
    }
};
```
