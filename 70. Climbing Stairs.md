# Description

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

# Solution
- Dynamic Programming
- just like Fibonacci sequence, when n >= 3, A(k) = A(k-1) + A(k-2)
```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n < 3)
            return n;
        int p = 1, q = 2;
        int ret;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i){
            ret = p + q;
            p = q;
            q = ret;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```
