# Description

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

# Solution
- It is very difficult to check the boundary conditions and special cases...
- atoi() is a function that:
```
Parses the C-string str interpreting its content as an integral number, which is returned as a value of type int.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters (as in isspace) as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many base-10 digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed and zero is returned.
```
- find the first element that not whitespace
- check an optional initial plus or minus sign
- calculate the ret, and check the boundary
- if meet other charactors, break
```

                    break;
                flag = -1;
                n = 1;
            }
            else if (str[i] == '+'){
                if (n == 1)

                n = 1;
            }
            else if (str[i] < '0' || str[i] > '9') 
                break;
            else {
                ret *= 10;
                ret += str[i] -'0';
                if (ret*flag > INT_MAX) return INT_MAX;
                if (ret*flag < INT_MIN) return INT_MIN;
            }
        }
        return ret*flag;
