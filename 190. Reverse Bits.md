# Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

# Solution

- convert decimal to binary, then push 0 at the back.
- from back, covert binary to decimal
```
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
        vector<int> bi;
        int ret = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            bi.push_back(n%2);
            n /= 2;
        }
        while (bi.size() < 32)
            bi.push_back(0);

        int seed = 1;
        for (int i = bi.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            ret += bi[i] * seed;
            seed *= 2;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```
