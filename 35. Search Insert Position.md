# Description

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Here are few examples.
[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0

# Solution

### O(n)
```
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            if (nums[i] >= target)
                return i;
            else
                continue;
        }
        return nums.size();
    }
};
```

### O(logn)
use binary search
```
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.size()-1, mid;
        while (l <= r) {
            mid = l + (r - l)/2;
            //if (nums[mid] == target || target < nums[mid] && target > nums[mid-1])
                //return mid;
            if (nums[mid] < target)
                l = mid + 1;
            else
                r = mid - 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
these two lines can be deleted for the reasons listing below:
- after while, l > r, l >= r + 1;
- target is between [l, r+1], so l <= r + 1;
- l = r + 1;
- the index is between [l, r+1] = [l, l], which means that l is the desired index
- so we return l
